title: 4.5 to 4.6
description: This guide covers upgrading a 4.5 Spree application to Spree 4.6.
---

<Note>
If you're on an older version than 4.5 please follow previous upgrade guides and perform those upgrades incrementally, e.g.

1. [upgrade 4.2 to 4.3](4.2-to-4.3)
2. [upgrade 4.3 to 4.4](4.3-to-4.4)
3. [upgrade 4.4 to 4.5](4.4-to-4.5)
</Note>

## Update Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'spree', '>= 4.6'
```

Update all other spree gems used in your application to 4.6.0 or version compatible with 4.6:

```ruby
gem 'spree_sample', '~> 4.6'
gem 'spree_emails', '~> 4.6'
gem 'spree_frontend', '>= 4.6'
gem 'spree_backend', '>= 4.6'
gem 'spree_gateway', '~> 3.10'
gem 'spree_auth_devise', '>= 4.5'
gem 'spree_i18n', '~> 5.1'
```

## (Optional) Remove spree\_globalize

If your application used the spree\_globalize extension, you can remove it from your Gemfile, as translations are now supported out-of-the-box with the [Mobility](https://github.com/shioyama/mobility) gem.

We've configured Mobility to use [a strategy that uses a separate table to store translations](https://dejimata.com/2017/3/3/translating-with-mobility#strategy-2), just like how spree\_globalize did. This means, you won't need to make any changes to the database structure or migrate data.

During the upgrade process, you may need to review your custom queries that rely on translations, as there are minor differences in how Mobility handles them. Spree 4.6 includes a few [built-in concerns](../../customization/i18n) to make it easier to work with translatable models.

## Update gems

```bash
bundle update
```

## Install missing migrations

```bash
bin/rake railties:install:migrations
```

## Run migrations

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Note: If you didn't use spree\_globalize before, this will install migrations that move some columns from spree\_products, spree\_taxons, to dedicated translation tables -> spree\_products\_translations, spree\_taxons\_translations etc.

If you're using raw SQL queries (either in the application code, or running in external tools), you may need to review the new structure and update your queries accordingly.

## Run Additional Commands for Frontend

If using [Spree Frontend](https://github.com/spree/spree_rails_frontend), run the following additional commands to get everything set up correctly with the updated gems:

```bash
bin/rails javascript:install:esbuild
bin/rails turbo:install
bin/rails g spree:frontend:install
yarn build
```

And that's a wrap! :tada:
