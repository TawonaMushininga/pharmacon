# Products

Products are at the core of any e-commerce site. Indeed selling them is the whole reason behind opening a store in the first place.

From your store’s Admin Interface, you can manage all of the common tasks associated with managing your products. To reach the Admin Interface, first log into your store with your admin user account, then go to the `/admin` directory of your site. Click the “Products” tab.\
