1. Add [Spree Analytics Trackers](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_analytics_trackers) to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'spree_analytics_trackers', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_analytics_trackers'
```

1. Install the gem using Bundler:

```bash
bundle install
```

1. Copy and run migrations:

```bash
bundle exec rails g spree_analytics_trackers:install
```

You're good to go!
