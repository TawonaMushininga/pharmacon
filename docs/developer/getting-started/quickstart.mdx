## Getting Started with Spree Commerce

Welcome to the Spree Commerce documentation guide. Follow the instructions below to learn how to build and deploy your Spree Commerce store.

### 1. Installing Spree

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Creating Your Spree Repository">

    To create your Spree store repository please, follow these instructions:
    
    1. Use [Spree starter template](https://github.com/new?template_name=spree_starter&template_owner=spree) to create your own repository

    ![Starter Template](/images/starter_template.png)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Setting up Your Development Environment">

    <Note>
      If you're on Windows remember to [install the Linux subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) before proceeding.
    </Note>

    1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/)
    2. Once git is installed, clone your docs repository using `git clone <your-repo>`. If you haven't set it up yet, now would be a good time to do so with these [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
    3. Open a terminal and go to the repository directory
    4. Run setup commands:

        ```bash
        bin/setup
        ```
    5. And finally start the development server with:

        ```bash
        bin/rails s
        ```
  </Accordion>  

  <Accordion icon="box" title="Adding sample data">

    To add sample data to your store, run:

    ```bash
    bin/rake spree_sample:load
    ```

    This will add a some products, categories, and will setup a checkout flow to your store.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Exploring Your Store

Spree enables you to easily customize your store. You can change the look and feel, checkout flow, add your own business logic, etc.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Logging into the Admin Dashboard">
    Use your browser window to navigate to [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin). You can log in with the default credentials:
      - login: `spree@example.com`
      - password: `spree123`

    Upon successful authentication, you should see the admin screen:

    Feel free to explore some of the Admin Panel features that Spree has to offer and to verify that your installation is working properly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Browsing Storefront">
  
    Spree comes with a default pre-built Storefront. You can access it by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
    
    You can later customize this Storefront or choose another one if you prefer Next.js or Vue.js.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="pencil" title="Adding Content">

    Add content with simple MDX files. Initiate your pages with this template:

    ```md
    ---
    title: "Page Title"
    sidebarTitle: "Sidebar title (optional - if different from page title)"
    description: "Subtitle (optional)"
    ---
    ```

    Learn more about adding images, tables, lists, and more using the [MDX syntax](/content/text). We also offer a wide array of components which are listed [here](/content/components).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Pushing Your Changes">

    Once ready, commit and push your changes to update your docs site. Here is a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push) on how to do that. If the Github app is unable to successfully deploy your changes, you can manually update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Deploying Your Store

Spree can be deployed on any platform - cloud, bare-metal, Docker, Kubernetes, etc. We've provided a [guide](/deployment/overview) to help you get started.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Generating API References">

    You can easily set up your API references using an OpenAPI document.

    1. Add your `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json` file into your docs repository or define the `openapi` field in `mint.json` with a URL.

    ```json
    "openapi": "link-to-your-openapi-file"
    ```

    2. Use our [scraper](/api-playground/openapi/setup#autogenerate-files-recommended) to autogenerate your OpenAPI endpoints files as:

    ```bash
    npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-or-url-to-openapi-file>
    ```

    3. Finally, include the generated endpoint MDX files to your `mint.json` under `navigation`.

    For a complete guide on using Spree with OpenAPI, check out [this guide](/api-playground/openapi/setup). [This guide](/api-playground/openapi/writing-openapi) explains how to configure your API authentication methods. For manual API references definition, explore [our syntax](/api-playground/overview).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="star" title="Adding a Custom Domain">

    Integrate your docs into your website by hosting them on a custom domain. This is included even in the free Spree plan. Navigate to your [dashboard settings](https://www.dashboard.mintlify.com/settings) to add a custom domain.

    ![Custom Domain](/images/custom-domain.png)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="chart-simple" title="Adding Analytics">

    Our in-house analytics give you insights into page views, search analytics, session recordings and more. Access these on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/analytics). We also support integrations with a range of analytics providers. You can find the list of providers [here](/integrations/analytics/overview).
