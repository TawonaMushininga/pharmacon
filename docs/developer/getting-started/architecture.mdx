Spree is built on top of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) and handful of other Ruby libraries. Spree itself is a modular platform consisting of several modules (gems).

As many Rails applications Spree requires a rational database to run. Spree supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL. You can also use SQLite.

### Core gems

<Info>
These gems are the core of Spree and they are the most important part of the Spree platform. They are the building blocks that make Spree possible.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Core">
    The core module is the heart of Spree, containing the essential components and functionalities that power Spree stores. This includes the models, services, and the backend logic necessary to manage products, orders, payments, shipping, and more.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API">
    The API module provides a [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) programmable interface to Spree, allowing developers to interact with the Spree store programmatically. This is useful for integrating Spree with other systems, building mobile applications, or customizing the frontend of a Spree store.

    API gem also includes Webhooks which are a way to let Spree know when something happens in the store. For example, when an order is placed, the API gem can send a webhook to a 3rd party service to let them know about the order.

### Spree Starter

Spree Starter is a starter kit that you can use to get started with Spree. It provides a ready-to-go setup for a Spree store, with all the necessary configuration and structure. It's a great way to get familiar with Spree and start building your own store.

If you followed the installation guide, you should have a Spree Starter store ready to go. If you want to learn more about Spree Starter, you can find more information in the [Spree Starter README](https://github.com/spree/spree_starter).

### Extensions

Extensions are Spree plugins that add new features or functionality to a Spree store. They are developed and maintained by the Spree community.
