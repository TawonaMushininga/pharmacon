title: Users
---

In your Spree application you will usually have 2 types of users:

* Customers - who are the users who will be purchasing products.
* Admins - who are the users who will be managing the Spree store

<Info>
If you're using [Spree Auth Devise](https://github.com/spree/spree_auth_devise) which comes with Spree Starter the default user class will be `Spree::User`
</Info>

Customers can have:

* **Addresses**, both billing and shipping
* **Orders** - a list of products that the user has purchased
* **Credit Cards** - used on the checkout page to pay for the order
* **Store Credits** - assigned by the store owners, to be used to purchase products
* **Wishlists** - a list of products that the user has marked as a wishlist

## User attributes

Here's the list of attributes for the default `Spree::User` model:

| Attribute         | Description                                                                 | Example Value       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `email`           | The email address of the user.                                              | `user@example.com`  |
| `ship_address_id` | References the default shipping address associated with the user.                   | `2`                 |
| `bill_address_id` | References the default billing address associated with the user.                    | `3`                 |

There will be lots more attributes provided by [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem, but these are the most important ones for the user.

## User roles

Each User can have different roles attached, eg. `admin` (which will grant them access to the Spree admin).

To attach a role to a user, you can use this code:

```ruby
user = Spree::User.find_by(email: "spree@example.com")
role = Spree::Role.find_or_create_by(name: 'admin')

user.spree_roles << role
```

## User methods

`Spree::User` includes several [ActiveRecord concerns](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.1.3.2/classes/ActiveSupport/Concern.html), which provide additional methods for the user model.

Some handy methods are listed below:

```ruby Returns the last incomplete order for the given store.
user.last_incomplete_spree_order(store)
```

```ruby Returns the total amount available store credits for the user in the given store.
user.available_store_credits(store)
```

```ruby Returns the default Wishlist for the given Store.
user.default_wishlist_for_store(store)
```

```ruby Returns a list of all active payment sources, e.g., credit cards that can be used on the checkout.
user.payment_sources
```

## User Permissions

Spree under the hood uses library called [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) to handle authorization.

More on permissions can be found in the [Customize Permissions guide](/developer/customization/permissions). We recommend you check this guide after reading all other Core Concepts.

## Rolling out your own User class

You can change the default User class from `Spree::User` to your own class. This comes in handy when you want to integrate Spree with a 3rd party authentication provider or you need to integrate Spree with your current Rails application.

You can also use different user classes for customers and admins.

More information can be found in the [Customize Authentication guide](/developer/customization/authentication).
