## Overview

Promotions within Spree are used to provide discounts to orders, offer free shipping or to add potential additional items at no extra cost (eg. samples).

Promotions are one of the most complex areas within Spree, as there are a large number of moving parts to consider. Although this guide will explain Promotions from a developer's perspective, if you are new to this area you can learn a lot from the Admin &gt; Promotions tab where you can set up new Promotions, edit rules & actions, etc.

Promotions can be activated in three different ways:

* When a user adds a product to their cart (automatic promotions, eg. free shipping with a threshold)
* When a user enters a coupon code during the checkout process
* When a user visits a page within the Spree store (path-based promotions, eg. a promotion that offers a discount on a specific page)

Promotions for these individual ways are activated through their corresponding [PromotionHandler class](https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/main/core/app/models/spree/promotion_handler), once they've been checked for eligibility.

Promotions relate to two other main components: `actions` and `rules`. When a promotion is activated, the actions for the promotion are performed, passing in the payload from the `fire_event` call that triggered the activator becoming active. Rules are used to determine if a promotion meets certain criteria in order to be applicable.

In some special cases where a promotion has a `code` or a `path` configured for it, the promotion will only be activated if the payload's code or path match the promotion's. The `code` attribute is used for promotion codes, where a user must enter a code to receive the promotion, and the `path` attribute is used to apply a promotion once a user has visited a specific path.

 Path-based promotions will only work when the `Spree::PromotionHandler::Page` class is used, as in `Spree::ContentController` from [spree_rails_frontend](https://github.com/spree/spree_rails_frontend)

A promotion may also have a `usage_limit` attribute set, which restricts how many times the promotion can be used.

## Actions

There are four actions that come with Spree:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Creating an Adjustment">
    <p>When a <code>CreateAdjustment</code> action is undertaken, an adjustment is automatically applied to the order, unless the promotion has already applied an adjustment to the order.</p>
    <p>Once the adjustment has been applied to the order, its eligibility is re-checked every time the order is saved, by way of the <code>Promotion#eligible?</code> method, which uses <code>Promotion#eligible_rules</code> to determine if the promotion is still eligible based on its rules. For how this process works, please see the <a href="promotions#rules">rules section</a> below.</p>
    <p>An adjustment to order from a promotion depends on the calculators. For more information about calculators, please see the <a href="calculators">Calculators guide</a>.</p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Creating an Item Adjustment">
    <p>When a <code>CreateItemAdjustments</code> action is undertaken, an adjustment is automatically applied to each item within the order unless the action has already been performed on that line item.</p>
    <p>The eligibility of the item for this promotion is re-checked whenever the item is updated. Its eligibility is based on the rules of the promotion.</p>
    <p>An adjustment to order from a promotion depends on the calculators. For more information about calculators, please see the <a href="calculators">Calculators guide</a>.</p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Free Shipping">
    <p>When a <code>FreeShipping</code> action is undertaken, all shipments within the order have their prices negated. Just like with prior actions, the eligibility of this promotion is checked again whenever a shipment changes.</p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create Line Items">
    <p>When a <code>CreateLineItem</code> action is undertaken, a series of line items are automatically added to the order, which may alter the order's price. The promotion with an action to add a line item can also have another action to add an adjustment to the order to nullify the cost of adding the product to the order.</p>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Registering a New Action

You can create a new action for Spree's promotion engine by creating a new file in `app/models/spree/promotion/actions/` directory, inheriting from `Spree::PromotionAction`, like this:

```ruby
module Spree
  module Promotion
    module Actions
      class MyPromotionAction < Spree::PromotionAction
        def perform(options={})
          ...
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

You can access promotion information using the `promotion` method within any `Spree::PromotionAction`.

This action must then be registered with Spree, which can be done by adding this code to `config/initializers/spree.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  Rails.application.config.spree.promotions.actions << MyPromotionAction
end
```

Once this has been registered, it will be available within Spree's interface. To provide translations for the interface, you will need to define them within your locale file. For instance, to define English translations for your new promotion action, use this code within `config/locales/en.yml`:

```yaml
en:
  spree:
    promotion_action_types:
      my_promotion_action:
        name: My Promotion Action
        description: Performs my promotion action.
```

## Rules

Here's a list of all the rules that come with Spree:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="FirstOrder">
    The user's order is their first.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ItemTotal">
    The order's total is greater than (or equal to) a given value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Product">
    An order contains a specific product.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User">
    The order is by a specific user. Only customers who have an account can use this rule.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="UserLoggedIn">
    The user is logged in.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="One Use Per User">
    Can be used only once per customer. Only customers who have an account can use this rule.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Taxon(s)">
    Order includes product(s) associated with Taxons that are selected for this rule.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Country">
    Checks if Order's ship address country matches the selected country, eg. US-only Orders
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Rules are used by Spree to determine if a promotion is applicable to an order and can be matched in one of two ways: all of the rules must match, or one rule must match. This is determined by the `match_policy` attribute on the `Promotion` object. As you will see in the Admin, you can set the match\_policy to be "any" or "all" of the rules associated with the Promotion. When set to "any" the Promotion will be considered eligible if any one of the rules applies, when set to "all" it will be eligible only if all the rules apply.

### Registering a New Rule

As a developer, you can create and register a new rule for your Spree app with custom business logic specific to your needs. First, define a class that inherits from `Spree::PromotionRule`, like this:

```ruby
module Spree
  class Promotion
    module Rules
      class MyPromotionRule < Spree::PromotionRule
        def applicable?(promotable)
          promotable.is_a?(Spree::Order)
        end

        def eligible?(order, options = {})
          ...
        end

        def actionable?(line_item)
          ...
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The `eligible?` method should then return `true` or `false` to indicate if the promotion should be eligible for an order. You can retrieve promotion information by calling `promotion`.

If your promotion supports some giving discounts on some line items, but not others, you should define `actionable?` to return true if the specified line item meets the criteria for promotion. It should return `true` or `false` to indicate if this line item can have a line item adjustment carried out on it.

For example, if you are giving a promotion on specific products only, `eligible?` should return true if the order contains one of the products eligible for promotion, and `actionable?` should return true when the line item specified is one of the specific products for this promotion.

To register this new rule add this block in your `config/initializers/spree.rb` file:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.after_initialize
  Rails.application.config.spree.promotions.rules << Spree::Promotion::Rules::MyPromotionRule
end
```

 Proper location and file name for the rule in this example would be: `app/models/spree/promotion/rules/my_promotion_rule.rb`

To get your rule to appear in the admin promotions interface you have a few more changes to make.

Create a partial for your new rule in `app/views/spree/admin/promotions/rules/_my_promotion_rule.html.erb`.

This file can be as simple as an empty file if your rule requires no parameters, or it may require more complex markup to enable setting values for your new rule. Check out some of the rule partials provided with Spree in the backend sources.

And finally, your new rule must have a name and description defined for the locale you will be using it in. For English, edit `config/locales/en.yml` and add the following to support our new example rule:

```yaml
en:
  spree:
    promotion_rule_types:
      my_promotion_rule:
        name: "My Promotion Rule"
        description: "Rule to define my new promotion"
```

Restart your application. Once this rule has been registered, it will be available within Spree's admin interface.
