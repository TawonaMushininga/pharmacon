# Adjustments represent a change to the +item_total+ of an Order. Each adjustment
# has an +amount+ that can be either positive or negative.
#
# Adjustments can be "opened" or "closed".
# Once an adjustment is closed, it will not be automatically updated.
#
# Boolean attributes:
#
# +mandatory+
#
# If this flag is set to true then it means the the charge is required and will not
# be removed from the order, even if the amount is zero. In other words a record
# will be created even if the amount is zero. This is useful for representing things
# such as shipping and tax charges where you may want to make it explicitly clear
# that no charge was made for such things.
#
# +eligible?+
#
# This boolean attributes stores whether this adjustment is currently eligible
# for its order. Only eligible adjustments count towards the order's adjustment
# total. This allows an adjustment to be preserved if it becomes ineligible so
# it might be reinstated.
